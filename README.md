Hello all, I'm Felix! 

I love learning new things and this is where I like to keep my fun apps. I enjoy social media, dogs and music, so the apps I create are a mixture of those types of applications. 
I'm currently looking into contributing into opensource projects and to participate into hackathons as I feel like it will help expand my knowledge and experience. 
I am a full stack developer with 1+ years experience, and I also have 10 years of luxury retail management under my belt.
